jsh is a minimalistic shell written in C that works in a REPL fashion

Implementation of this project demonstrates how a shell executes syscalls.

Its minimalistic design comprises a lot of limitations, such as:

- Lack of multi-line command parsing
- No I/O redirection (WIP)
- Lack of builtin binaries.


This is implementation serves as a starting point for an ongoing project that implements linear algebra builtins such as matrix, vector and tensor operators that can handle multiple optimization algorithms, see 'jaclar' (Just Another C-Linear Algebra Runtime) for further details.
